# CHIPA_Act [ Research Capstone - Advised by Dr Li Gan ] 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
During the Covid-19 Pandemic, as workers were sent home to do their jobs remotely, demand for semiconductors skyrocketed to a level the industry was not prepared for, leading to a supply shortage that has created setbacks in several other industries. In prior decades, chip developers had already been moving out of the United States, as American production of semiconductors had decreased to 19% of the worldâ€™s output, compared to 40% just 30 years earlier (Mazewski and Flores, 2022). This lack of American production of semiconductors has made it more costly to replenish the chip supply and created enough incentive for the Federal Government to act.
The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (i.e. CHIPS) for America Act was passed by Congress in 2021 and enacted on August 9th, 2022 with the intention of creating financial incentives for semiconductor developers operating in the United States. The article published by Mazewski and Flores in May of 2022 analyzed the mechanisms of the law that will allow for job development and economic growth. Two years following this publication, we plan to add to their analysis now that there is a sizable sum of financial data regarding the semiconductor industry since the passage of the CHIPS Act.
We have three specific questions in mind to assess the effectiveness of the CHIPS for America Act through its first two years in effect. First, how has the CHIPS Act affected the stock performance of corporations involved in semiconductor development? Second, has the CHIPS Act simulated investment in the semiconductor industry? Finally, has the CHIPS Act attracted investment in the United States?

## OBJECTIVES
We have two primary objectives that we hope to achieve through our research in the Semiconductor Industry. Our objectives are to:
Empirically determine whether or not the United States is moving toward self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing and design.
Improve understanding of how government policies benefit investors, short-term.
